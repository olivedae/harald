        It's quite an apt gatt, gap, and ap we have here.


    ~ What is Harald?

      Harald is a modern implementation of Bluetooth Low
      Energy for Rust. Harald allows for elegant and
      logical communication between devices through
      using low-level, type-safe abstractions
      over the Bluetooth stack's various protocols
      and procedures.

    ~ Is it ready?

      Not quite. There are still significant features
      and details to be built and decided on.
      Every so often I come back to work on it.
      Features left to do and details to be ironed
      out can be found in issues.

    ~ What do I need?

      For the moment there is a limited amount of
      required dependencies. However,
      using `cargo build` will take care of
      installing what is need by Harald.

    ~ Where are the docs?
